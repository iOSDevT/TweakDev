The site at jontelang.com/guide/ is generated from the markdown (.md) files found in the folder "text". Each file will be joined at the time I generate the website so the order matter (the order is acheived with the name). Try to keep each main section (H1 or \#) in its own file. If you want to add a new main header between two already existing sections/files just do as the "resources" section and change the name to 1.2 to make it sit inbetween them.

The files in this repo are not directly linked to the website, after a pull request I will download, generate and publish it. This is because the files on the website is static.

Make sure you don't write a header with the same name as another one, the static-page-generator will not like that.
